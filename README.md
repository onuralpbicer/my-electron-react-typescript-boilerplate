`npm run dev` to build and watch for changes
`npm run start` to run app(note, ctrl+r refreshes for react changes if dev is also running, but for express changes, you gotta close the app and re-run start)
`npm run build` to just build
`npm run build:win` to get a windows installer
`npm run build:mac` to get a mac installer
